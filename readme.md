# TUICord

---

TUICord is an extremely light (when compared to electron) terminal-based Discord client
written in Rust with Ratatui.

### Major feature goals are:

- Image Support (real image for terminal emulators with the Kitty Graphics Protocol like kitty and ghostty)
- Full Vim-**style** keyboard control
- Role colors (ideal on truecolor terminals, 16 colors should be sufficient)
- Various Discord features such as profile preview, possibly embed support, etc.
- Eventually voice call support?
